<p style='text-align: justify;'> Daniel has been interested in computers and electronics since he was a little boy, enthralled at a young age in how computers work and a huge desire to dismantle electronics and see those small cities. Although his interest in technology, most of his time was spent on his grandmother's ranch along side dogs, chickens and other farm animals adventuring around in the countryside, swimming in the closest creek and helping his grandma with the ranch's labors.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The time passed and the places had to change, so he now lives in a bigger city distant from his hometown, he started studying Telecommunications Engineering moved by his interest on how the things work and in particular the electronics and communications world.</p>
